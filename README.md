# Ideators-Server

This is the backend server code for the bigger project currently I am working on.
The idea of this project is to optimize the use of co-working space.
Users can Scan the QR-code of the desk they want to use and start using it.
At the end of the session, a bill will be generated and credits will be debited from the user's profile.

### Setup:
**Step-1:**
Clone the repository

**Step-2:**
Setup your own MongoDB Atlas and copy the URI

**Step-3:**
Create default.json file in the config directory and past the URI here, also create JWTSecret here

**Step-4:**
Run "`npm start`" in your terminal

### Future repositores of this project are goin to be:
1. Ideators-Frontend
2. Ideators-Hardware
