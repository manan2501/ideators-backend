# Ideators-Backend

This is the backend code for the bgiger project currently I am working on.
Idea of this project is to optimize the use of co-working space.
User can Scan the QR-code of the desk they want to use and start using it.
At the end of session bill will be generated and crdits will be debited from the users profile.

### Setup:
**Step-1:**
Clone the repositor

**Step-2:**
Setup your own MongoDB Atlas and copy the URI

**Step-3:**
Create default.json file in config and past the URI here, also create JWTSecret here

**Step-4:**
Run "`npm start`" in your terminal

### Future repositores of this project are goin to be:
